As input for visualizing we have a matrix,
which includes values per node/mesh/voxel in MRI and the
 index(location of node)

 it would be n*2 shape or n*2*t (for animation).
 The n represents the number of node/mesh/voxel,
 2 includes the index and strain value.



We have T1 mri images of entire head, we use HD-BET (High-Definition Brain Extraction Tool)
to remove everything from MRI head scan that is not brain, works well!
